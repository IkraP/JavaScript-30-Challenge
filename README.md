My solutions to the @wesbos JavaScript 30-day Challenge 

## Project Intro: 
My degree in chemistry gave me skills that are universal, having an analytical mindset in dealing with problems systematically and being creative in any project given. After graduation, I decided to work within commercial labs in the hope to pursue a career in research. My roles were eminently experimental, and I mostly enjoyed the practical exposure, however, I felt unchallenged and the work became intelligible. I decided to explore my options and stumbled across a hackathon which was incredible and this is where my coding journey starts!

Only having the basic JavaScript syntax knowledge, this challenge was a steep learning code but I found the more I progressed through the challenges, the code became more familiar and I knew a lot more than day 1. 

## Day 01: JavaScript Drum kit 
### Thoughts ...  

Knowing only the basic syntax, the first day was very difficult to understand!
I learnt the use of data-* global attributes to have personal data pockets that are specific to your project that can be used link your HTML and JavaScript. 

The ability to utilise the users keyboard input using the <kbd> tag. This was used to specify which key will be associated with what sound from the @wesbos provided sounds. 
  
I learnt the use of document.querySelector to select the data-keys and audio.play() to actually play the audio in the HTML code. 

### One thing i will take away...
The existance of e, which is an event that can be linked to an event listener to handle events on the page.
